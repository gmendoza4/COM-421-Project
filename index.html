            <h3>About Me:</h3>
                <p>
                    I am a first year college student at the Illinois Institute of Technology,
                    currently working on my bachelor's in Computer Science with a minor in Applied Mathematics.
                    I take part in student activities on campus such as RHA, AASA, and Lettuce Club. Outside of school,
                    I like to play tennis, videogames, and powerbuild. My favorite foods are sushi, pasta, and salmon. In the future,
                    I hope to work for startups in the city as a Software Engineer, and one day make the next big company.
                </p>
