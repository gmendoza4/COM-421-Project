    Upon launching the website, you will see my formating of the navigation as a sidebar,
with the main content taking up the right 80% of the page. My home page features an about me section,
describing some things I am working on and like to do. My resume page has my original pdf version 
available to download through the navigation header and the css formatted version on the page itself.
There are clickable options for my email and number to easily contact me. The projects page has some of the
club opportunities I am trying to organize in bulleted format. Every page has a profile picture of me and my 
name as the header, with the IIT red as the background color. The navigation also matches in red and is in the
fixed format for easier access wherever on the page. 
    If I had more time, I would have made my pages more responsive to different electronics(phone friendly). I would
also like to add more images, but I found it difficult to format different sections to proper sizes. Most of my time
was spent trying to figure out how padding and margins work with each other to appropriatly size the sections of my resume,
though, I feel I have been getting efficient at spacing text and sections now.
